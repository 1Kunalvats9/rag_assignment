During this journey I contributed in the development of the website for Go For Gold, ICPC Bootcamp. This was an amazing journey, we
developed this website using React JS and Tailwind CSS for the learners across the globe to become a part of this bootcamp.
Dory Oct 2024 Present
–
Built a high-performance Golang-based RAG backend enabling students to query PDFs and notes using semantic search, vector
databases, and LLMs, featuring secure multi-tenancy, concurrent ingestion, event detection, and production-ready cloud deployment.
Applied core computer science concepts such as Hash Maps for metadata caching to optimize user session lookups, Arrays & Slices
for vector representation and cosine similarity calculations in semantic search, Trees for recursive document chunking preserving
context, and Concurrent Queues with Goroutines and Channels to implement a worker pool ensuring scalable and crash-resistant
PDF processing under high concurrency.
Applied strong problem-solving skills to independently identify, analyze, and resolve technical bottlenecks in backend systems,
improving query accuracy and system reliability for student-facing learning tools.
Movie Recommendation System Dec 2025 Dec 2025
–
Developed a Netflix-style recommendation system using Python ML, vectorization, and cosine similarity to generate personalized
movie suggestions, exposing the model via FastAPI and integrating it into a SwiftUI-based mobile application.
Dory Swift Application 01/2023
Developed a SwiftUI app featuring a modern Glassmorphism UI and smooth animations, delivering a polished, real-time chat interface
for AI-powered querying of PDFs and notes. Integrated seamlessly with a high-performance Golang RAG backend that supports
semantic search using vector databases and LLMs. Engineered secure multi-tenancy, concurrent PDF ingestion, and event-driven
processing to ensure scalability and reliability. Applied advanced computer science concepts including hash maps for caching, vector
operations for semantic similarity, tree-based recursive document chunking, and goroutine-based worker pools to optimize
concurrency and system performance under heavy load.
